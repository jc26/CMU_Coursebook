This project was built by Zhouchenye Peng, Runsha Long, and Jason Chang as part of our 15-437 term project. 

Our website uses with Django, Bootstrap, and other code that we found online or wrote ourselves. It is called CMU Coursebook and it aims to redesign the Faculty Course Evaluations (FCE) website, integrated with some features of the Student Information Online (SIO) website, making an easy-to-use, fast-to-access, and comprehensive course information platform. Students can have a single platform to access all the course information as well as provide feedback to courses they are currently taking. Our website can query the evaluation data compared to the current FCE. It also has a comment feature for each course/faculty member where students can post their opinions directly on the evaluation site for others to see. They can also connect with other friends and see what courses their friends are taking, have taken, or plan to take. Our website even provides data visualization for evaluation data to aid students in choosing courses that best fit their interests, as well as helping faculty members improve their courses. 

To upload course or history data, you must be a faculty member with a super-user privilege. A super-user can make other users faculty members as well.
